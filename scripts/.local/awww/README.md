In here you will find example scripts to help you get started writing your own
scripts to work with `awww` for various effects. Currently, there are scripts
for:

  * Randomly going through the images in a directory (awww_randomize.sh)
  * Changing with which image `awww` is initialized according to the time of day
  (awww_init_according_to_time_of_day.sh)
  * Scheduling changes to the wallpaper at different times of day
  (awww_scheduler.sh)
