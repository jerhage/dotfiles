# My dotfiles

## Setup using symlinks

- `stow */` to create symlinks for all or `stow dir_1 dir_2 ...` for specific directories
- yazi and tmux have plugins with their own git configurations.
  - For the time being, to avoid problems, I have add these to the `.gitignore` of this repo.  As a consequence, remember to clone the plugins into the proper directory (aka `yazi/.config/yazi/plugins` for yazi)
